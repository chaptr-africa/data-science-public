### Modules
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py. For example, if we have a file named hello.py with the following contents:
```
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
We can import it into another file using the `import` statement:
```
```
import hello

hello.say_hello("World")
```
This will output `Hello, World!` to the console.

We can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the from ... `import` statement:
```
from hello import say_hello

say_hello("Python")
```
This will output `Hello, Python!` to the console.

### Packages
A package is a way of organizing related modules together. A package is simply a directory containing a special file called `__init__.py`. The `__init__.py` file can be empty, or it can contain Python code that is executed when the package is imported.

Let's say we have a directory structure like this:
```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```
We can import the modules like this:
```
import my_package.module1
import my_package.module2

my_package.module1.function1()
my_package.module2.function2()
```
Or we can use the `from ... import ...` statement to import specific functions or variables:
```
from my_package.module1 import function1
from my_package.module2 import variable2

function1()
print(variable2)
```
This will execute `function1()` from `module1.py` and print the value of `variable2` from `module2.py`.

### Conventions
When working with modules and packages, it's important to follow some conventions to make your code more readable and maintainable. Here are some best practices to follow:

- Use descriptive names for modules and packages. This will make it easier for other developers to understand what your code does.
- Use lower_case_with_underscores for module and package names. This is the recommended naming convention in Python.
- Use relative imports within a package. For example, if you have a module named `module1.py` and another module named `module2.py` in the same package, you should use the following import statement in `module2.py`:
```
from . import module1
```
This tells Python to look for `module1.py` in the same package as module2.py.

Avoid using * in `from ... import ...` statements. This can make it difficult to understand which functions or variables are being imported, and it can also lead to naming conflicts.

Use `if __name__ == "__main__"`: to define a block of code that should only be executed if the module is run as the main program. This is a common convention in Python, and it allows you to write code that can be both imported as a module and run as a standalone program.

## Test-driven development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process where developers write tests before writing the actual code. The tests check the functionality of the code, and the code is written to make the tests pass. TDD helps ensure that the code is reliable, maintainable, and can be refactored without breaking. In this tutorial, we'll cover TDD in Python and demonstrate the process with examples.

### Setting up the Environment
To get started, you need to install the following:
- Python 3
- The unittest module that comes with Python
You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `python --version`
### Writing Tests
The first step in TDD is to write tests that check the functionality of your code. You'll use the unittest module to write these tests.

Here's an example of how to write a test for a function that calculates the factorial of a number:
```
import unittest

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

class TestFactorial(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_factorial(self):
        self.assertEqual(factorial(0), 1)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(1), 1)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(2), 2)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(3), 6)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(4), 24)
```
In this example, we define a function called `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number. Then, we create a test case class called `TestFactorial` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside the class, we define a test method called `test_factorial` that checks the output of the factorial function for different input values.

The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the output of the `factorial` function is equal to the expected value. If the output is not equal to the expected value, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed.
### Running Tests
To run the tests, you can use the following command: `python -m unittest <test_file_name>`

In the example above, the test file name is test_factorial.py. So, to run the tests, you would use the following command: `python -m unittest test_factorial`

If all the tests pass, you'll see an output similar to the following:
```
....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
If any of the tests fail, you'll see an output similar to the following:
```
..F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_factorial (__main__.TestFactorial)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_factorial.py", line 14, in test_factorial
    self.assertEqual(factorial(2), 1)
AssertionError: 2 != 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.000s

FAILED (failures=1)
```
### Writing Code
Once you've written the tests, the next step is to write the code that makes the tests pass. The goal is to write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the tests pass.

Here's an example of how to write the code for the factorial function:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
In this example, the `factorial` function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. If the input is 0, the function returns 1. If the input is not 0, the function returns `n * factorial(n-1)`, where `n` is the input.

### Re-running Tests
After writing the code, re-run the tests to see if they pass. If all the tests pass, you're done! If any of the tests fail, fix the code and re-run the tests until all the tests pass.

Here's an example of what the output might look like after running the tests:
```
.....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
### Refactoring
Once the tests pass, you can refactor the code to make it more readable, efficient, or maintainable. However, before refactoring the code, re-run the tests to make sure they still pass. If any of the tests fail, fix the code and re-run the tests until all the tests pass.

In the example above, the `factorial` function is simple and efficient, so there's no need to refactor it.
