# SQL Programming and RDBMS Design Curriculum
Our SQL Programming and RDBMS Design course is structured for learners enrolled in our **Data Science Foundations Course** and **Data Science Core Track** bootcamps. 
The course is modelled based on the [Girraffe's Academy](https://www.giraffeacademy.com/databases/sql/) SQL Course
The course goes through the SQL and data base design fundamentals required to be a full stack data scientist or anyone venturing into the data management field. Here is a breakdown of our programming curriculum:

## Week 4: Introduction to Power BI
## Week 5: SQL and Data Analysis Capstone
Student will work on a project involving querying a database and connecting this to a Power BI Dashboard. 

## Next Steps â€“ Power BI Immersion
The student is advised to undertake an extensive training on Power BI, as it is a key tool in visualizing and manipulating data using it's power query module.
