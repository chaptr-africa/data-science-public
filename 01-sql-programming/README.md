# SQL Programming and RDBMS Design Curriculum
Our SQL Programming and RDBMS Design course is structured for learners enrolled in our **Data Science Foundations Course** and **Data Science Core Track** bootcamps. 
The course is modelled based on the [Girraffe's Academy](https://www.giraffeacademy.com/databases/sql/) SQL Course
The course goes through the SQL and data base design fundamentals required to be a full stack data scientist or anyone venturing into the data management field. Here is a breakdown of our programming curriculum:

## Week 1: Introduction to Databases and SQL

| 1.2 | Introduction to SQL  | What is SQL. What is MySQL. MySQL Installation on Windows. MySQL Installation on Mac | CHALLENGE: Run a model and test its results on a cross-validation versus a train-test-split |
| 1.3 | Building Tables | Create Tables. Inserting Data. Table Constraints | QUIZ: Determining Tidy Data and how to outlier and missing data |
| 1.4 | Basic Queries | Update Queries. Alter Tables. Delete Queries. Describe | CHALLENGE: Given a dataset, conduct data preprocessing to output clean data for machine learning |
| 1.5 | SQL Baasics Weekly Project | PROJECT involving running basic SQL queries by running SQL scripts for an NGO based data and creating veiws | | |


## Week 2: Intermediate SQL Queries

| 3.2 | ACID Concepts in Database | Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability | CHALLENGE: Run a model and test its results on a cross-validation versus a train-test-split |
| 3.3 | Database Normalization | Crawfords Notation Recap, Redundancy Concepts, 1 NF, 2 NF, 3 NF | QUIZ: Determining Tidy Data and how to outlier and missing data |
| 3.4 | Data Models Challenge |  Conceptual and Physical Schemas in Real Life | CHALLENGE: Given a data model, relationships between the different fields and/or tables, and link this to the business situation|
| 3.5 | Data Models Challenge | PROJECT involving using information given by a hypothetical client to design a hospital database with multiple departments or service points | | |

## Week 4: Introduction to Power BI
## Week 5: SQL and Data Analysis Capstone
Student will work on a project involving querying a database and connecting this to a Power BI Dashboard. 

## Next Steps â€“ Power BI Immersion
The student is advised to undertake an extensive training on Power BI, as it is a key tool in visualizing and manipulating data using it's power query module.
