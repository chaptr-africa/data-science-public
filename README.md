### Additional Skills
All our graduates will also have access to bonus modules covering key concepts and skills for their careers in technology. These include:
1. Cloud Computing with **Amazon Web Services** or **Microsoft Azure** (On program completion)
2. Data Algorithms and Data Structures (On program completion)
3. Bonus enrichment programs (Workshops are available to all students after every 5-week module sprint:
  - **Career Development:** Learn some of the key professional skills for your general career. The module covers everything from Resumes/CVs, Personal Branding to Handling Job Interviews. [View the curriculum to learn more](https://chaptrglobal.com/blog/bootcamp/python-data-science-bootcamp/).
  - **Tech Entrepreneurship:** We seek to build graduates who do not rely entirely on available job opportunities but rather can work on building solutions to existing local problems and eventually provide more employment opportunities for their local economies. The program covers the primary tech startup skills from design thinking, market research, minimum viable product to advanced concepts such as startup financing, product analytics, and legal structures.

## Our Learning Model
Chaptr is an entirely virtual bootcamp pedominantly focused on young learners from Africa's developing nations. Here are the key details on our operations model:

### Our Program Structure
We employ a part-time tual program structure that runs in 5-week sprints (with a one-week break after every module for our bonus enrichment programs) as follows:
1. **Prerecorded Content:** Learn virtually through our curated video and text courses on our learning management system
2. **Weekly Live Workshops:** Practice-focused live classes run by our team of technical mentors twice weekly.
3. **One-on-One Appointments:** Schedule sessions and eet a technical mentor to work through programming problems.
4. **Weekly and Capstone Projects:** Practice through curated dev projects each week and after every module.
5. **Job Placement Support:** Work on corporate-sourced projects and get linked to our growing corporate network.

### Post-Program Certification
Our graduates take top industry certifications by **Amazon Web Services**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure** on completion of the program. Here are the certifications recommended for our Data Science Graduates:
1. AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification
2. Microsft Azure Data Science Associate Certification
3. AWS Big Data Specialty Certification (For Data Engineering)
4. Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate Certification (For Data Engineering)
5. Google Tensorflow Deep Learning Certification (For Deep Learning with TensorFlow)
